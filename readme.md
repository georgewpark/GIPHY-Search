## Project Setup

From the root directory, install project dependencies by running `npm install` from the terminal.

Build the files and start the local dev server by running `npm run dev` from the terminal. This should open the dev site automatically at http://localhost:3000/.

You can build the files without starting the dev server by running `npm run build` from the terminal to compile the development build or `npm run prod` to compile the production build.
